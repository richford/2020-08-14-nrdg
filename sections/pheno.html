      - Before I go into some of predictions of each conceptual model, I want
        to convince you that we can study them using HBN and ABCD.
      - The HBN has a number of questionnaires that are relevant to child
        adversity. Most importantly, they have the ACE questionnaire for
        subjects 18+ and the NLES for subjects 8-18.
      - I don't have access to the HBN pheno data yet but I believe the NLES
        is the same NLES designed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to
        measure chronic stress in their national indigenous population. It
        can be viewed as an expanded form of the ACE questionnaire that also
        includes stressors in the community like crime, interactions with
        police, and discrimination and racism.
      - The good news, Ethan reports, is the HBN records the responses to
        each question so it should be possible to decompose adversities into
        the different dimensions.
      - There are additional questionnaires like the APQ and the CPIC that
        could also yield information about both threat and deprivation.
      - We just got access to ABCD yesterday, so I'm not intimately familiar
        with the study's massive phenotypic data, but it looks like there are
        questions that would capture the threat dimension at the very least.
      - The KSADS PTSD questionnaire asks about exposure to many different
        types of trauma
      - And the Life events questionnaire captures even more events, from
        witnessing crime, to having a parent with a substance abuse issue, to
        being the victim of violence. It also records the recency of the
        experience and in the followup visits, asks the subjects to rate the
        positivity or negativity of the event.
      - And if you want something like cumulative risk, the PhenX scores
        total up the responses to these life events
