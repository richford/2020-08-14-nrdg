      - Before I go into some of predictions of each conceptual model, I want
        to convince you that we can study them using HBN and ABCD.
      - The HBN has a number of questionnaires that are relevant to child
        adversity. Most importantly, they have the ACE questionnaire for
        subjects 18+ and the NLES for subjects 8-18.
