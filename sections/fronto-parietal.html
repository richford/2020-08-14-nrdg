      - Okay, maybe you feel like the threat dimension has been getting all the love.
      - The fronto-parietal network is involved in working memory and cognitive control
        and is predicted to be particularly influenced by experiences of deprivation.
      - (Aside: encompasses the dlPFC, dmPFC, superior parietal cortex)
      - (Aside: these studies include superior frontal and middle frontal
        gyri, frontal pole, superior parietal lobule, intraparietal sulcus)
      - For tractometry, this network would include the SLF, the superior
        longitudinal fasciculus, and the IFOF, inferior fronto-occipital
        fasciculus.
      - In the first two rows, we see measures of dlPFC structure and
        superior parietal cortex structure. These are measuring either volume
        or cortical thickness. We see consistent reductions in
        fronto-parietal structure in children with deprivation exposure and
        inconsistent or null results in threat exposed or mixed-adversity
        samples.
      - For the connectivity related differences. The large sample study from
        Gur et al. reported increases FA in the SLF in children exposed to
        trauma, while another much smaller sample reported no trauma-related
        differences.
      - Two of the four deprivation studies showed reduced FA, one in the SLF
        and one in the IFOF. And the other two found no deprivation related
        differences.
      - Likewise mixed results for mixed-adversity samples.
      - So the findings for structural connectivity are highly mixed and I
        think this is an area where we could really add value.
