      - So those are open problems that sort of fit within the existing
        framework of adversity research
      - There are other more exploratory questions that could be really
        exciting
      - We could investigate the substructure of these adversity dimensions.
        McLaughlin's main insight was that adversity itself isn't unitary and
        she proposed threat and deprivation as the first two dimensions.
      - Well, is there really any reason to expect that threat and deprivation
        should themselves be unitary.
      - So just as a cartoon kind of illustration, imaging that we have some
        sort of tree-based decomposition of adversity. The dimensional model
        currently slices at the first branch cut, where there are two
        dimensions. Would it be informative to cut instead at the second
        level, where the dimensions are further decomposed into subtypes.
      - And do we need to decide a priori what that decomposition should be,
        or could we use a more data-driven approach in the style of
        this Nature article by Drysdale et al.
      - Drysdale studied depression using resting state fMRI in a sample of
        about 1100 people. They started with BOLD time series from 258
        spherical ROIs, created these 258x258 functional connectivity
        matrices, defined a low-dimensional representation using CCA,
        canonical correlation analysis, then clustered subjects in this
        low-dimensional representation.
      - So using this data-driven approach, they defined four novel subtypes
        of depression that transcended the current diagnostic classification
        scheme and better predicted responsiveness to transcranial magnetic
        stimulation therapy.
      - I would really like to use an unsupervised method like this to see if
        we can identify useful adversity subtypes that might be distinict
        from the a priori diagnostic classifications.
      - Another avenue is to expanding conceptual models to include loss and
        unpredictability.
      - We think loss of an attachment figure, either due to parental death
        or forced separtion, should be important for neurodevelopment but we
        don't know exactly how.
      - ABCD captures data on loss through its questionnaires but it reamins
        to be seen whether we can isolate loss from exposure to other adversity
        types.
      - Likewise, unpredictability is thought to be important to
        developmental plasticity. Maternal unpredictability and environmental
        variability has lasting effects on neurodevelopment in rodent models.
      - So it seems important to extend these models to humans but I'm really
        confused as to how to even measure environmental predictability.
      - There are also open questions about the importance of exposure timing.
        There's a concept of so-called "sensitive periods," which are
        developmentally specific periods of heightened neural plasticity,
        when certain types of environmental inputs are more likely to produce
        lasting changes in behavior and the organization of neural circuits.
      - These periods have been identified for sensory domains (remember the
        kittens), for language development, for face processing. But a big
        open question is whether there are sensitive periods for adversity.
        This seems more relevant for deprivation, where expected
        environmental inputs are lacking. For threat, there's not really a
        developmental period where the brain expects to experience threat.
        But still, even for the threat dimension, perhaps trauma could alter
        the timing of other sensite periods.
      - So that's a really complicated question that requires large-cohort,
        longitudinal data like we have in ABCD. And if you're interested I
        would love thinking with any of you about how to formulate questions
        about exposure timing And if you're interested I would love thinking
        with any of you about how to formulate questions about exposure
        timing.

      - So those are the really open problems. Those are the kind that could
        easily occupy me for my postdoc and probably my whole career.
      - And then there's one massively confusing, big honkin' open problem
        that centers around this concept of resilience.
