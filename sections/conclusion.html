      - So to recap, we know that different types of adversity shouldn't be
        treated equally from a neurodevelopmental point of view.
      - And that mixed-adversity samples yield inconsistent results.
      - So it's tempting to just see if we can predict ACE score using the
        tractome. And we might try that since it's simple.
      - But really, we need to distinguish between adversity types and
        control for co-occurence of exposures.
      - The dimensional model predicts that threat exposure will lead to
        alterations to the fronto-amygdala network and hippocampal circuits
        due to enhanced aversive learning.
      - And it predicts that deprivation will lead to early excessive pruning
        in the frontoparietal and frontostriatal networks.
      - And I'd say those predictions are mostly supported.
      - The stress development theory specifically predicted premature
        development in the fronto-amygdala network
      - And that isn't really supported, at least by the evidence in the
        review I've cited here.
      - But there is evidence for more global accelerated development.
      - There's longstanding evidence that children exposed to trauma
        experience puberty earlier.
      - And there are hints that the neurodevelopment is consistent with this.
      - As we develop, cortical thickness decreases and structural
        connectivity increases.
      - And that's exactly what we saw with trauma exposed children as well.
      - The Gur et al. study found increased FA in the uncinate, cingulum, and SLF.
      - They also build a machine learning model to estimate adulthood and
        found that the trauma exposed kids were more likely to be
        misclassified as adults.

      - First off, there are more results for rs-fc and task-based fc than
        for structural connectivity and throughout the talk there have been
        some areas with mixed results.
      - So the first thing we can address is clarification or confirmation
        of structural connectivity in the uncinate, cingulum, SLF, IFOF, and
        fronto-striatal tracts.
      - We can also evaluate evidence for the stress acceleration model and
        whether it occurs globally across the whole brain or is confined to
        specific networks and also whether those locations vary by the
        adversity type.

      - So those are open problems that sort of fit within the existing
        framework of adversity research
      - There are other more exploratory questions that could be really
        exciting
      - We could investigate the substructure of these adversity dimensions.
        McLaughlin's main insight was that adversity itself isn't unitary and
        she proposed threat and deprivation as the first two dimensions.
      - Well, is there really any reason to expect that threat and deprivation
        should themselves be unitary.
      - TODO: Add text here about decomposition
      - TODO: Add text about Drysdale et al.
      - Expanding conceptual models to include loss and unpredictability.
      - We think loss of an attachment figure, either due to parental death
        or forced separtion, should be important for neurodevelopment but we
        don't know exactly how.
      - ABCD captures data on loss through its questionnaires but it reamins
        to be seen whether we can isolate loss from exposure to other adversity
        types.
      - Likewise, unpredictability is thought to be important to
        developmental plasticity. Maternal unpredictability and environmental
        variability has lasting effects on neurodevelopment in rodent models.
      - So it seems important to extend these models to humans but I'm really
        confused as to how to even measure environmental predictability.
