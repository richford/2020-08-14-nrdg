      - So I tried to go a little fast to leave time for discussion, but let
        me review and talk about open problems which will hopefully seed a
        discussion.

      - So to recap, we know that different types of adversity shouldn't be
        treated equally from a neurodevelopmental point of view.
      - And that mixed-adversity samples yield inconsistent results.
      - So it's tempting to just see if we can predict ACE score using the
        tractome. And we might try that since it's simple.
      - But really, we need to distinguish between adversity types and
        control for co-occurence of exposures.
      - The dimensional model predicts that threat exposure will lead to
        alterations to the fronto-amygdala network and hippocampal circuits
        due to enhanced aversive learning.
      - And it predicts that deprivation will lead to early excessive pruning
        in the frontoparietal and frontostriatal networks.
      - And I'd say those predictions are mostly supported.
      - The stress development theory specifically predicted premature
        development in the fronto-amygdala network
      - And that isn't really supported, at least by the evidence in the
        review I've cited here.
      - But there is evidence for more global accelerated development.
      - There's longstanding evidence that children exposed to trauma
        experience puberty earlier.
      - And there are hints that the neurodevelopment is consistent with this.
      - As we develop, cortical thickness decreases and structural
        connectivity increases.
      - And that's exactly what we saw with trauma exposed children as well.
      - The Gur et al. study found increased FA in the uncinate, cingulum, and SLF.
      - They also build a machine learning model to estimate adulthood and
        found that the trauma exposed kids were more likely to be
        misclassified as adults.

      - So that's a very brief summary. Let me talk about about open problems.
      - These are things that I think we could shed light on with the HBN and
        the ABCD study.
      - First off, there are more results for rs-fc and task-based fc than
        for structural connectivity and throughout the talk there have been
        some areas with mixed results.
      - So the first thing we can address is clarification or confirmation
        of structural connectivity in the uncinate, cingulum, SLF, IFOF, and
        fronto-striatal tracts.
      - We can also evaluate evidence for the stress acceleration model and
        whether it occurs globally across the whole brain or is confined to
        specific networks and also whether those locations vary by the
        adversity type.

      - So those are open problems that sort of fit within the existing
        framework of adversity research
      - There are other more exploratory questions that could be really
        exciting
      - We could investigate the substructure of these adversity dimensions.
        McLaughlin's main insight was that adversity itself isn't unitary and
        she proposed threat and deprivation as the first two dimensions.
      - Well, is there really any reason to expect that threat and deprivation
        should themselves be unitary.
      - So just as a cartoon kind of illustration, imaging that we have some
        sort of tree-based decomposition of adversity. The dimensional model
        currently slices at the first branch cut, where there are two
        dimensions. Would it be informative to cut instead at the second
        level, where the dimensions are further decomposed into subtypes.
      - And do we need to decide a priori what that decomposition should be,
        or could we use a more data-driven approach in the style of
        this Nature article by Drysdale et al.
      - Drysdale studied depression using resting state fMRI in a sample of
        about 1100 people. They started with BOLD time series from 258
        spherical ROIs, created these 258x258 functional connectivity
        matrices, defined a low-dimensional representation using CCA,
        canonical correlation analysis, then clustered subjects in this
        low-dimensional representation.
      - So using this data-driven approach, they defined four novel subtypes
        of depression that transcended the current diagnostic classification
        scheme and better predicted responsiveness to transcranial magnetic
        stimulation therapy.
      - I would really like to use an unsupervised method like this to see if
        we can identify useful adversity subtypes that might be distinict
        from the a priori diagnostic classifications.
      - Another avenue is to expanding conceptual models to include loss and
        unpredictability.
      - We think loss of an attachment figure, either due to parental death
        or forced separtion, should be important for neurodevelopment but we
        don't know exactly how.
      - ABCD captures data on loss through its questionnaires but it reamins
        to be seen whether we can isolate loss from exposure to other adversity
        types.
      - Likewise, unpredictability is thought to be important to
        developmental plasticity. Maternal unpredictability and environmental
        variability has lasting effects on neurodevelopment in rodent models.
      - So it seems important to extend these models to humans but I'm really
        confused as to how to even measure environmental predictability.
      - There are also open questions about the importance of exposure timing.
        There's a concept of so-called "sensitive periods," which are
        developmentally specific periods of heightened neural plasticity,
        when certain types of environmental inputs are more likely to produce
        lasting changes in behavior and the organization of neural circuits.
      - These periods have been identified for sensory domains (remember the
        kittens), for language development, for face processing. But a big
        open question is whether there are sensitive periods for adversity.
        This seems more relevant for deprivation, where expected
        environmental inputs are lacking. For threat, there's not really a
        developmental period where the brain expects to experience threat.
        But still, even for the threat dimension, perhaps trauma could alter
        the timing of other sensite periods.
      - So that's a really complicated question that requires large-cohort,
        longitudinal data like we have in ABCD. And if you're interested I
        would love thinking with any of you about how to formulate questions
        about exposure timing, because it confuses me. And again I'm trying
        to differentiate between things that confuse me and things that
        confuse the field.
