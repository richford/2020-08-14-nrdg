      - The hippocampus is a region that's involved in associative learning
        and episodic memory
      - It also plays a role in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
        axis, including terminating the adrenal response after a stressor has
        ended.
      - In animal models, high levels of cortisol lead to reductions in
        hippocampal dendritic branching and neuronal loss
      - So for all of these reasons, hippocampal volume is a frequent target
        of research in relation to child adversity.
      - In the top row, we see that reductions in hippocampal volume are
        reported most consistently for threat-related adversity. And
        inconsistently for deprivation and mixed-exposure samples.
      - The next two rows show you hippocampal activation in reponse to
        either threat related cues or to memory tasks.
      - For threat-related cues, there's really no consistent pattern of
        differences in hippocampal activation.
      - For the memory tasks, there are a smaller number of studies by
        Lambert et al, that looked only at children exposed to threat. These
        involved matching faces with other stimuli and changing whether the
        faces were threatening or neutral. So they'd show you an angry face
        in a dining room, and a neutral face in a park, let's say. They'd
        image you while you saw the faces and then also test you later and
        ask something like hey did you see this face in the kitchen or the
        park. For children without threat exposure, they performed well with
        both angry and neutral faces. But for children with threat exposure,
        they showed reduced hippocampal activation and poorer performance on
        the memory task when the faces were angry.
      - I think this makes sense...it's like saying okay Jason and Ariel,
        please memorize this slide, but oh by the way, Jason, I'm gonna put a
        hungry lion in your room. I think Ariel would perform better on the
        memory task and Jason would send more metabolic resources to his
        amygdala than his hippocampus.
      - I think it also underscores a theme here. That these children's
        brains aren't just flawed in some random way. These changes are
        adaptive. They really do need to respond to potential threats. It's
        just that those changes are maladaptive once we can get them out of the
        threatening environment.
      - Finally, let's look at hippocampal-PFC connectivity. And like before, this
        combined rs-fc, task-based fc, and structural connectivity, so we need to
        be careful. But for the threat dimension, most studies suggest
        greater hippocampus-PFC connectivity. Most relevant to our research program,
        the Gur et al. study found higher FA in the cingulum in children
        exposed to trauma.
      - In constrast, two smaller studies found reduced FA in the cingulum in
        children exposed to deprivation, with the remaining studies finding
        null association.
      - And in mixed-adversity samples, some studies report reduced FA in the
        cingulum while others report a null association.
