      - So most studies of emotional processing following adversity have
        concerned themselves with the amygdala.
      - But there's a network of regions the extend beyond the amygdala-mPFC
        circuit and respond to stimuli that have motivational salience but are
        not necessarily threatening.
      - This is called the salience network, good name, and includes the
        insula and dACC, among others.
      - These pie charts show differences in activation of salience network
        regions during threat processing tasks. We see null associations for
        deprivation and mixed adversity samples.
      - And some studies suggest positive associations with insula activation
        and negative associations with dACC activation.
      - Personally, I find it unsatisfying to motivate the study of the
        salience network by noting its importance to responsing to broader
        motivationally salient stimuli beyond threat processing, and then to
        study using only threat assessment tasks.
