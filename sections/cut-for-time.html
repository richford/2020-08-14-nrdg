      - So those are the really open problems. Those are the kind that could
        easily occupy me for my postdoc and probably my whole career.
      - And then there's one massively confusing, big honkin' open problem
        that centers around this concept of resilience.
      - When I think of resilience, I think of the tardigrade here on the
        left, which can withstand a temperature range of 400 degrees,
        pressures from the vacuum of space to the bottom of the Marianas
        trench, and raditation levels of about 5000 Grays, which is about
        1000 times more than what will kill a human.
      - And when we study childhood adversity, we see that some kids are just
        little tardigrades. For some reason, they don't seem to develop
        psychopathology as a result of adversity exposure and they may even
        show positive adaptations to it.
      - Early studies treated it as an inherent trait or characteristic.
      - Later studies used a cumulative model, where you count positive and
        negative measures of the development environment, and if the sum is
        positive, you say that the subject had resilience.
      - More recently, it's understood as a dynamic and interactive process
        involving interactions between the individual and the environment.
      - And if you remember back to the beginning of the talk, this kind of
        progression in the conceptual framework may sound awefully familiar.
      - It's a lot like what we went through with the definition of
        adversity.
      - And I think the field is coalescing around the idea that resilience
        is another facet of the development environment. But we don't yet
        have a common definition of resilience, let alone a conceptual model
        that breaks it down into different dimensions that might make
        different neurodevelopmental predictions.
      - So if I somehow solve all those other open problems in the next few
        weeks, it would be good look at the interplay of adversity and
        resilience in neurodevelopment.
