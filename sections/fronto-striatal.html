      - There are dopaminergic circuits that involve projections from the
        striatum to the PFC and play a role in reward learning, organizing
        behaviors in the approach and consumption of rewards, etc.
      - From a structural connectivity point-of-view, these include
        the anterior corona radiata, external capsule, and anterior limb of
        the internal capsule. I was chatting with Jason about this last night
        and we'd have to add some more ROIs to segment those tracts specifically
        but it should be possible to examine fronto-striatal connectivity in this
        way.
      - The top row here is showing striatal activation in response to reward
        processing tasks, like seeing positive relative to neutral images,
        anticipating reward, and reward receipt. The differences are
        consistent between the studies but distinct between the adversity
        dimensions. Deprivation exposure is associated with reduced striatal
        activation. But trauma and mixed-exposure samples show heightened
        activation. This would seem to support the premature pruning
        hypothesis for deprivation.
      - Frontostriatal connectivity, as measured by FA and rs-fc, show
        inconsistent results. The non-null studies all show reduced FA
        in the frontostriatal tracts.
