      - So to recap, what I've tried to convince you of is that the
        cumulative risk model, although it has good predictive power for later
        life outcomes, isn't a good conceptual model to study neurodevelopment.
      - And we probably don't yet have the optimal conceptual model for
        childhood adversity.
      - But we have these two modern models, that, as all good models should,
        make predictions about neurodevelopment.
      - So what I'd like to do now, is briefly step through the different
        brain networks involved in these two models and see what kind of
        evidence there is.
      - And I'm informed here by a developmental psychology annual review
        from last year by McLaughlin et al. So all the figures you see are
        taken from there.
      - So first up is the fronto-amygdala network (aka amygdala-mPFC, aka
        limbic system)
      - The amygdala plays a central role in threat detection and responding
        to salient stimuli, so its presence here isn't too surprising.
      - And the way to read these pie charts is that they represent the
        proportion of studies that find either positive (orange), negative
        (blue), or null (grey) associations between the type of adversity
        and the brain measure.
      - Top is amygdala volume. And we see that reductions in amygdala volume
        are most consistent among children exposed to threat but not among
        those exposed to deprivation or in mixed exposure samples.
      - Amygdala activation refers to studies that contrasted negative
        emotional stimuli (like an angry face) with neutral emotional stimuli
        (like a table or something). In two studies, instead of neutral
        stimuli, they used the intertrial interval instead of a neutral
        stimulus. Here again, we see that hightened amygdala activation is
        most consistent in the threat dimension, and inconsistent in the
        deprivation dimension and in mixed exposure samples.
      - mPFC structure refers to either cortical thickness, volume, or
        surface area. And we see that reductions in volume and thickness are
        consistent in the threat dimension but not really in deprivation or
        in mixed adversity samples.
      - And finally, we have connectivity, which is one of the only measures
        on this slide where the deprivation dimension is consistent. It turns
        out that children exhibit positive task-based functional coupling
        between amygdala-mPFC, whereas adolescents and adults exhibit
        negative functional coupling. But previously institutionalized
        children exhibited negative functional connectivity. So this supports
        the accelerated development model in the case of deprivation.
      - Things are less clear in the threat dimension. Here, connectivity is
        measured either by FA in the uncinate fasciculus, which is probably
        the closest to what we'd measure, or resting-state functional
        connectivity of the amygdala with the mPFC. Here's a chance to
        evaluate the accelerated development model too because higher FA here
        would represent more mature development. Likewise for rs-fc.
        Accelerated development hasn't been observed in the rs-fc studies but
        it there are mixed results for FA studies, with two small studies
        yielding null and one 1,400 participant study showing higher FA.
      - However, in task-based functional connectivity studies, there's more
        evidence for accelerated development. The tasks all involved some
        sort of emotional processing but the tasks were different so
        comparison is hard.
      - So this is one area where I think we could help clarify things.
