      - One of the earliest, paradigmatic models relating ACEs to later-life health and well-being
      - CDC/Kaiser Permanente ACE Study (1995-1997)
      - Surveyed 17,000 subjects regarding childhood experiences and current health status.
      - Found Negative lifelong impacts on well-being
      - ACE pyramid is conceptual framework for the study.
      - Near base of pyramid is disrupted neurodevelopment (neuroplasticity)
      - They posited that disrupted neurodevelopment cascades into later life, leading to negative outcomes

      - Another way to show this comes from Stephanie DeCross and Katie McLaughlin's poster at this year's OHBM conference
      - I like this one because I think they're intentionally subverting he "March of Progress" meme and at the same time showing that 
        childhood trauma is a robust indicator for psychopathology.

    <div data-markdown>
      - More broadly, the ACE study is a cumulative risk model
      - This is the prevailing approach to conceptualizing adversity
      - In these models, all adversities are created equal and it is the number
        of distinct types of adversity that matters.
      - So a child who experienced physical abuse, sexual abuse, and witnessed
        domestic violence would have an ACE score of three.
      - And another child who experienced poverty, neglect, and maternal
        depression would also have an ACE score of three
      - My own editorializing here:
      - Saying that each distinct type of adversity will have an effect of equal
        magnitude on any developmental process in question doesn't accord with my
        own intuition
      - And yet, it's impressive that making that assumption still explains, in a
        predictive sense, these later-life outcomes.
      - Now if you ask why, you get a lot of language about disruptions in
        stress response system and something called allostatic load, which is a
        fancy way of saying wear and tear on the body through stress.
      - But the neurodevelopmental pathways through which adversity affects health
        haven't really been explored through cumulative risk models
      - I think because treating all adversity equally is not specific enough
        to consider neurodevelopmental mechanisms.

    <div data-markdown>
      - A more sophisticated risk model has been proposed by Katie McLaughlin
        and Margaret Sheridan.
      - In this model, it's not the isolated experiences that are important but
        rather the idea that ACEs reflect the underlying environment in which
        neural development is taking place.
      - This theory supposes that one can identify underlying dimensions of the
        environment and that different dimensions have different effects on
        development.
      - McLaughlin and Sheridan have proposed threat and deprivation as two
        initial dimensions
      - So experiences like physical and sexual abuse, witnessing domestic
        violence, and community exposure to violence all involve a threat of harm
      - And ACEs like neglect, institutional rearing, and parental absence are
        high on the deprivation axis.
      - Other dimensions are possible, these are just two, and I'll talk
        about that at the end.
      - And poverty or SES don't map neatly onto the dimensions. Within the
        dimensional model, poverty is a context that increases risk in all
        dimensions.

        and emotional regulation.
      - And these cognitive processes have established neuroanatomical correlates
      - like the fronto-amygdala (amygdala-mPFC) system (a.k.a. limbic system)

      - Deprivation in contrast, involves lack of social and cognitive stimulation
      - Expected to hinder development in much the same way as sensory deprivation.
      - So this picture depicts synaptic density across the human lifespan.
      - For the first few years of our lives, there's a proliferation of
        connections between neurons
      - And for the rest of our lives, these connections are pruned away
      - Our brains get more efficient based on the environment in which they
        develop and the experiences that they have had. We're getting rid of
        stuff we don't need in order to process information more effectively.

      - But this normal process of synaptic pruning can be maladaptive if we're
        deprived of input that our brains expect
      - One kind of heartwrenching example comes from early experiments on
        visual deprivation in animals
      - Early visual deprivation in kittens, (Hubel and Wiesel)
      - Blindfolds on kittens for early stages in development
      - Led to early and extreme pruning in visual cortex
      - The brain says, I'm not using this, I don't need it, I'm going to get
        rid of it.
      - I woudn't dare show you mistreated kittens in this presentation so
        let's all just take a moment to appreciate the glory of leg-stretch kitty
        and face-palm kitty.

      - McLaughlin's insight was that social and cognitive deprivation would
        lead to the same kind of maladaptive pruning as sensory deprivation.
      - In this case, it might not be visual input that's lacking but social
        or linguistic experience, let's say.
      - And in particular the dimensional model predicts early pruning in
        the fronto-parietal network that supports executive function

      - Another modern adversity model is the stress acceleration model.
      - Posits that adversity accelerates the pace of neural development.
      - We express this idea colloquially when we say that someone is an "old
        soul" or that they "grew up too fast."
      - The presence of a supportive caregiver scaffolds emotional learning
        while the fronto-amygdala circuits develop.
      - Either the absence (in the case of deprivation) or insensitivity (in
        the case of threat) of a caregiver accelerates development of
        fronto-amygdala circuits.
      - Adaptive in the short term to compensate for species-expectant parental
        buffering of emotional reactivity.
      - Leads to suboptimal emotional functioning in the long term.
      - Specifically predicts that amygdala-mPFC connectivity matures more quickly
      - So caregiver deprived children should have amygdala-mPFC connectivity that
        looks like those of adolescents or young adults who haven't experienced
        that kind of adversity.
